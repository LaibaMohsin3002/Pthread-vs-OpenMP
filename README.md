# Pthread vs OpenMP
 
Parallel Programming - Comparison of sorting Algorithms using

Pthreads vs. OpenMP vs. serial (3 algorithms)

1. Algorithm Selection:

● We will choose three sorting algorithms for comparison.

2. Implementation:

● Each sorting algorithm will be implemented using Pthreads, OpenMP, and serial
execution, ensuring consistency across all paradigms.

3. Analysis:

● Compare sorting algorithms' performance across Pthreads, OpenMP, and serial
execution.

● Measure execution time for each algorithm under different input sizes and thread
configurations.
